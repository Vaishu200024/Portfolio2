This sandboxed network diagram in VirtualBox consists of three core components: Ubuntu Desktop, a Server, and a Web Server. Each component connects to internal networks with private IP addresses and can simulate real-world environments for testing, networking, and server setups.
1. Ubuntu Desktop
* LAN Adaptor: 1
* VirtualBox Setting: Internal Network
* IP Address: 192.168.31.1
* This machine likely acts as a client device for testing connections to the server and webserver.
